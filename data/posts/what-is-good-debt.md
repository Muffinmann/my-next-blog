But what is a good debt? Before trying to answer this question, it is important to know, what kind of role has 'debt' played in the
economy development.

I'll use some simple mathematics to explain the concepts here to make it more intuitive.

To simplify the model, we suppose one's productivity growth the linear, so the productivity is a linear function of time:
```math
P = kt
```
Since by getting a debt we actually use the value we would have in the future right now, we can say we reallocate future years
productivity to the next few years. Each year we gain an extra productivity:
```math
\delta\bar{p} = (\delta P) / (\delta t)

```


the inflation rate is directly proportional to the economy growth. This is because the growing amount of credit leads to the increasing of the general
money, which results in the price rising of all goods.
