## Non-linear learning 

youtube pushed me this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9rwqxsd1w) and it narrates some ideas that
could increasing my learning efficiency massively by combining it with the 'what, how, why' method.
the core concept is to make the new knowledge relevant to the existing one. but if some kind of knowledge is totally new and does not match any existing one, how can we create the relevance?
the answer is using 'hypothesis', in which we create a knowledge structure even before we start learning, and gradually correct that hypothesis by learning. Theses can be achieved by following 6 steps:
1. scope the resource, this is similar to the 'what' step, but should be done before starting working on the topic.
2. use skim reading to capture some keywords
3. make an unordered list of all keywords and search for the words which are not familiar.
4. build the mind model based on the prior knowledge.

the motivation behind this method is because the human thinking is actually omnidirectional, but in order to make a clear structure by writing 
the book, the author has to linearize his thoughts in a way he thinks that it would make the most sense. but this pre-decided structure may not 
fit into out cognitive schema. so we need the hypothesis which is naturally generate by the brain and just refine/correct it by reading/learning.

## Investment

Some flash thoughts:

"Nobody makes a era, somebody is just able to follow the change of the time, and they get the success".

Invest on what you think would be the future.
In my current understanding, the future must be dominated by AI which requires lots of computational resource, and which in effect are related to the energy consumption and heat generation.
This trend is actually against the 'climate friendly' concept which all nations are trying hard for.
Which means, those companies who have the most advance cooling technology could have a good performance in the future.

## The key of Software Design

I've worked as a web developer for 2 years and have learnt pretty much Design Patterns as well as Data Structure and Algorithms in the work. They are very helpful by managing the complexity and quality of the software but recently I've realized, that the ultimate weapon to eliminate those complexities dramatically is how you design the data structure out of your business context. You need to pay attention to the very basic motivations of an idea and review whether the corresponding current design has the least friction for the data flowing in the application.


## Life

This weekend I made Kimchi with my girlfriend and her other friends, which is quite an impressive experience to me. This brings me some feelings of 
celebrating the Lunar New Year as I was still a kid.
