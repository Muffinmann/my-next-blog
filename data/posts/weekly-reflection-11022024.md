## The Economic Machine 
I started to invest on the stock market recently, and I am so overwhelmed by all kinds of information in the due diligence
because of not knowing how to interpret them. I feel the necessity to have my own mind model.
I come to the idea of using the [How the Economic Machine Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0) by Ray Dalio
as my start point because I watched it several years ago as I was still in the university and I was quite impressed by
the beautiful fractal structure in that video. 

It uses a very easy model consisting of only two parts: transaction and debt, to illustrate the mechanism of the economy system.
The whole system is built on top of some subsystems where the subsystems are built on top of their subsystems, and the smallest
building stone is a transaction between two people which are referred as buyer and seller.

The debt plays a role of some kind of resource distribution tool. But it has its downsides due to the nature of human being:
if it is not used properly to increase the productivity, then it will become a big burden which would eventually destroyed the
whole system.

Whether a debt is healthy or not depends on the incoming rate and the interest rate, or in other words, the increasing rate of
productivity and the increasing rate of a debt. If taking a debt can bring a higher increasing of productivity, then it is a good
debt. I will use a new post to talk more about this.

However, knowing how to analyzing the debt taking and the effect of the debt could be a good start to analyze a company.
I can image the real world would be more complicated, for example, use what kind of criteria to evaluate the effect of debt?
or how can me measure the debt taking for a strategical decision which takes more than several years?

I don't know, maybe nobody knows. But the important part is that I start to step forward discovering.


## When to sell the stock
1. The sell motivation should match the buy motivation.
2. Minimize regret: selling stock should be based on a rational decision making and be ready to accept the truth that the price would be very
different after selling (either positive or negative). After selling, need to accept the uncertainty as well as to avoid the Survivor Bias.
3. Having more business out of the market than that in the market. Do not rely on the investment on the stock market, but use it as a 
tool to diversify your asset.

## Energy Efficiency
We are looking for a new flat recently and I notice that by each property there is a energy efficiency class label. I wanted to find out
how would this energy efficiency affect financially and made a quick research. The energy consumption has a unit _kWh/(m&#178;a)_, which
can be interpreted as "kilo-watt hour per square meter per year".  There are totally 8 classes which is defined by the range of the energy
consumption:

| A+  | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H  |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
|30-  |50 |75 |100|130|160|200|250|250+|


Let's suppose two flats have the same area of 70m&#178; and the 1kWh electricity would take 30cent, and for each class we take the biggest number
in the range, and compare the cost of each class.
For example, the consumption difference between A+ and A is 50 - 30 = 20kWh/(m&#178;a),so the price difference would be 20 * 70 * 0.3 = 420 Euro per year.

|class    | A+  | A    | B     | C     | D     | E     | F    | G     | H    |
|---------|-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|------|
| A+      |0    | -420 |-945   |-1470  | -2100 | -2730 | -3570| -4620 |-5670 |
| A       |+420 | 0    |-525   |-1050  | -1680 | -2310 | -3150| -4200 |-5250 |
| B       |+945 | +525 |0      |-525   | -1155 | -1785 | -2625| -3675 |-4725 |
| C       |+1475| +1050|+525   |0      | -630  | -1260 | -2100| -3150 |-4200 |
| D       |+2100| +1680|+1155  |+630   | 0     | -630  | -1470| -2520 |-3570 |
