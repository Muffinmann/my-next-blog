## The Economic Machine 
Several years ago as I was still in the university, I watched one of the greatest economical video I've ever seen about
[How the Economic Machine Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0) by Ray Dalio.
I was quite impressed how easy the building block of a complex economic system can be explained. However, I was not very curious
about the difference between the real development and this model and did not relate the model to any of my existing knowledge.

Recently, since I started to invest on stock market, I feel the necessity to develope my own investment strategy and I think that
video is a good start point.

The key of a fast economic growth is the 'debt'. When talk about debt, people usually refer it to something as a burden that makes
the life more difficult. The credit card, the housing loan, the car loan...
However, "debt' itself is just a value exchange across time, and to some extent, it can facilitate the wealth growth if you know
how to use it properly. I'll use another post to describe the details about evaluating a debt and when is a debt good to take.

The most important part is that these principles can also be applied to single company and they offer a good criteria
to evaluate the company performance.


## When to sell the stock
1. The sell motivation should match the buy motivation.
2. Minimize regret: selling stock should be based on a rational decision making and be ready to accept the truth that the price would be very
different after selling (either positive or negative). After selling, need to accept the uncertainty as well as to avoid the Survivor Bias.
3. Having more business out of the market than that in the market. Do not rely on the investment on the stock market, but use it as a 
tool to diversify your asset.

## Energy Efficiency
We are looking for a new flat recently and I notice that by each property there is a energy efficiency class label. I wanted to find out
how would this energy efficiency affect financially and made a quick research. The energy consumption has a unit _kWh/(m&#178;a)_, which
can be interpreted as "kilo-watt hour per square meter per year".  There are totally 8 classes which is defined by the range of the energy
consumption:

| A+  | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H  |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
|30-  |50 |75 |100|130|160|200|250|250+|


Let's suppose two flats have the same area of 70m&#178; and the 1kWh electricity would take 30cent, and for each class we take the biggest number
in the range, and compare the cost of each class.
For example, the consumption difference between A+ and A is 50 - 30 = 20kWh/(m&#178;a),so the price difference would be 20 * 70 * 0.3 = 420 Euro per year.

|class    | A+  | A    | B     | C     | D     | E     | F    | G     | H    |
|---------|-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|------|
| A+      |0    | -420 |-945   |-1470  | -2100 | -2730 | -3570| -4620 |-5670 |
| A       |+420 | 0    |-525   |-1050  | -1680 | -2310 | -3150| -4200 |-5250 |
